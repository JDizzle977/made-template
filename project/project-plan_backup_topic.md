# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Effects of Climate Change on Agriculture in North and South America

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How do shifts in weather patterns, such as increased temperatures and extreme weather events, impact crop productivity across North and South America?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Climate change is among the most important emerging threats to agriculture, in which altered patterns of weather will continue to affect agricultural productivity; thus, it represents a factor that impinges on crop yields and food security. The project will review how extreme events like rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and higher frequencies of extreme events have impacted or will impact agricultural productivity throughout North and South America. The analysis pipeline processes and analyzes historical climate and crop data in search of patterns and trends that can relate to rising temperatures and extreme weather. These will then provide data-driven insights to support the development of risk mitigation strategies in agriculture and help ensure food security in those regions.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
