<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Wealth Distribution and Economic Success in the Americas

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How do economic indicators such as education and regional investment influence prosperity and income mobility in North America?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
In North America, some people do accumulate wealth or gain economic success exceedingly unequally. This project explores how factors such as education, investment, and regional differences impact income and economic mobility. By charting historical and current income and economic data, it examines what regions specifically bear most of the economic inequity burden and what factors have a positive relationship to both wealth and economic mobility. Such analysis may also provide insights to help policy makers implement strategies for better, more equitable access to economic prosperity.
